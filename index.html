        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I am a computer science student and aspiring software engineer,
          seeking an opportunity in the industry. I currently attend Portland
          State University and will be graduating at the end of the year with a
          BS in Computer Science. Iâ€™m extremely excited to start my career and
          further fuel my passion for technology and science by working with a
          leader in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          My university studies, complemented with my personal projects and two
          six month software development internships has lent me a deep
          understanding of advanced enterprise level programming in Java and C#.
          My personal drive and curiosity has driven me to self teach myself a
          growing list of languages such as Kotlin, Python and C/C++. My seven
          years in leadership positions in the bar and music venue industry has
          left me with the highest levels of work ethic, communication skills
          and customer service. These are the attributes that I know will make
          my contribution to a future company worthwhile.
